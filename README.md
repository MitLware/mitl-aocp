Example application of the 'Automated Open Closed Principle' to automated algorithm configuration of the Traveling Salesperson Problem.

This provides a concrete example of the approach described in [*"Extending the 'Open-Closed Principle' to Automated Algorithm Configuration"*](https://doi.org/10.1162/evco_a_00245) [1].

It uses ant-programming as a generative hyper-heuristic to automatically configure a local search framework with components which have different state dependencies.
